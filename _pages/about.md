I am currently a research and teaching assistant at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), where I am pursuing a PhD in computer science under the guidance of Professor [David Hyde](https://dabh.io/#). My academic journey began at  [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science.

My research is centered around integrating advanced machine-learning techniques into traditional computer graphics, with a special focus on physics-based simulations and animations. Additionally, my interests encompass a wide range of areas including computational physics, fluid dynamics, deep learning, computer vision, parallel computing, virtual reality, and rendering. For a more comprehensive overview of me, please refer to the detailed information provided in my CV(http://nurshat317.github.io/files/CV_1-17-2024.pdf).
