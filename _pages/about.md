I am currently a research and teaching assistant at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), where I am pursuing a PhD in computer science under the guidance of Professor [David Hyde](https://dabh.io/#). My academic journey began at  [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science.

My research focuses on integrating advanced machine-learning techniques with traditional computer graphics and computational physics. Additionally, I have a strong interest in parallel computing, 3D computer vision and generative models.
