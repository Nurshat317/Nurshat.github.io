I am currently a research and teaching assistant at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), where I am pursuing a PhD in computer science under the guidance of Professor [David Hyde](https://dabh.io/#).My academic journey began at  [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) where I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science.

My research is centered around leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to traditional computer graphics, focusing on physics-based simulation and animation. My research interests also span computational physics, fluid dynamics, deep learning, computer vision, parallel computing, virtual reality, and rendering.
