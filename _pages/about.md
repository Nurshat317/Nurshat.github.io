I am an undergraduate at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/).

Research interests
------

My research interests are about computer graphics and computational physics, more specifically, including VR/AR, parallel computing, physics based animation and simulation. Currently, my research is focusing on physics based simulation and animation.

Research experiences
------

Currently, I am doing remote research with Prof. [Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/), which is about elactic body simulation and solving linear system. Recently, I completed my own research project, as an intern, at the [the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.iscas.ac.cn/), advised by Prof. [XiaoWei He](https://peridynamics.com/index.html), the work is mainly about a new surface tension model of free surface flows simulation for SPH, which was recently submitted to [IEEE VR 2022 Conference](https://ieeevr.org/2022/). I was also got involved in some research about physical simulation in [PHYSIKA](https://github.com/PhysikaTeam/PhysIKA) team and VR at [KLMP](http://www.klmp.pku.edu.cn/) before joining the Prof. [XiaoWei He](https://peridynamics.com/index.html)'s group: [Peridyno](https://github.com/peridyno/peridyno).
