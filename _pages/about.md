I am an undergraduate student at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). Please find more detailed information from my [CV](http://nurshat317.github.io/files/CV_Nurshat.pdf) (updated on December 2021).
*My official legal name is **Nulixiati Mangnike**, **Nurshat Menglik** is my preferred
name.*

Research interests and experiences （Updated on 2022/2/24）
------

My research interests are about computer graphics and computational physics, more specifically, including VR/AR, parallel computing, physics based animation and simulation. Currently, my research is focusing on physics based simulation and animation.

Currently, I am working with Prof. [Xiaowei He](https://peridynamics.com/index.html), as a research intern at the [the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.iscas.ac.cn/). We are working on extending my previous research, this work is using a semi-analytical surface tension model to simulate free-surface flows with different types of boundaries, including thread-like objects (hair, brush). Recently, I worked on research with Prof. [Joseph Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/) as a remote intern, I explored efficient elasticity solvers for deformable body simulation and learned FEM. I was also got involved in some research about physical simulation in [PHYSIKA](https://github.com/PhysikaTeam/PhysIKA) team and VR at [KLMP](http://www.klmp.pku.edu.cn/) before joining the Prof. [Xiaowei He](https://peridynamics.com/index.html)'s group: [PeriDyno](http://peridyno.com/en/).
